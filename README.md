# chessAI
All credit goes to Sebastian Lague, he was the inspiration for this project.
Very nice voice, and incredible video on how chess AI works, even if you don't want to code it, it is a very entertaining video

Me attempting to code a chess bot in late Sohpomore year, very unfinished.
Later senior year I am planning to create chess again in either C, C++, or Java but better, and with a proper AI
